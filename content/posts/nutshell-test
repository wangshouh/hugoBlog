## To write a section,

just use headings & paragraphs like this! Then...

## To embed a section,

just make a link with :colon at the front... [:LIKE THIS](#ToWriteASection)!

## Details about linking to stuff

**To link to a section on the same page**, use a # followed by the text of the section's heading – capitalization, spaces, and punctuation don't matter.

[:This example](#ToEmbedASection) links to `#ToEmbedASection`

**To link to a section from a different page**, link to the URL, followed by # and section heading:

[:This example](https://ncase.me/faq/#GoodMentalHealth) links to `https://ncase.me/faq/#GoodMentalHealth`

**If you link to a page without a #SectionHeading**, it'll embed the *whole* article.

[:This example](https://blog.ncase.me/parable-of-the-hill-climber/) links to `https://blog.ncase.me/parable-of-the-hill-climber/`

**Three notes on embedding from other pages:**

1) Not sure if you're doing it right? Test your link in this demo page! (Remember the :colon in the link text, and the # for the section!)

2) Only embed from sites you trust! They can change their content at any time (but that's problem for regular links, too). You can mirror/copy the site to be extra safe.

3) The other site must either also have Nutshell installed, or [:CORS](../#cors) enabled. If you don't know if the other site has Nutshell/CORS, test out linking to it in this demo page.

## Other Fun Stuff

You want to embed an explanation, but no-one's written it yet & you can't be bothered to either? **Get the intro from a Wikipedia article** by linking to it!

[:Catgirl on English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgirl) links to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgirl)`

[:Baguette on French Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguette_(pain)) links to `https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguette_(pain)`

[:Universe on Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) links to `https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe`

**You can also link to YouTube videos so they can expand in-place.** You can even specify a specific starting time – on a YouTube page, click 'Share' then 'Start at [time]'.
